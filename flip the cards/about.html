   <p><strong><i>Hey there 👋🏻,<br>
    welcome to the world of flipping the cards...🃏<br>
To start this game you just need to click
 on the play icon ▶️ on your home page.
 By clicking on it, you will find a new page 
 opened where you find 10 cards displayed on the screen.
To flip the card you just need to click on a particular card 🖱️.
There are 5 characters hidden in these cards.
If you get the same character on both the cards in sequence,
score will be incremented or else you will get an alert "Gameover" 👎.
Whenever the score reaches 5 you will get an alert "You won the game" ✌️🤝.<br>
Everytime you reload the page, or the game ends, the score is set to zero.
<br><small>These scores are not stored anywhere.So once the game finishes you cannot refer them further.</small></i></strong>
